# The Open Source Lab

It's hard to not notice that training in computer science has been streamlined to primarily
fill industry-level engineering jobs. In this respect, a degree from a top university in
computer science is a lucrative choice for a young person to make. The path, and resulting
enterprise tools that result from this pipeline are impressive - advances in machine learning,
GPUs, and mobile technologies that are changing the world. However, in this overwhelming positivity,
it's easy to look over the empty space, or specifically, to ask where those same graduates *aren't* going.

As a research software engineer, I came out of traditional academia, and first hand
experienced the unintended result of this practice. Practicing reproducible science,
which on the simplest level is conducting an analysis to answer a scientific question, and
doing it again, was really challenging. It was ironic to me that I was sitting in the crux
of technology and innovation in Silicon Valley, but that the actual practice of research
involving programming and software was at least a decade behind. I also came to realize that 
standard, and elegant practices from software engineering, namely version control, 
testing, and open source development, were all that were needed to solve many 
of these issues. I didn't see job security or even a clearly paved career 
path in front of me, but I decided that the need was dire enough, and inspiring for 
me that I wanted to pursue it. I abandoned a traditional academic route, and turned down
those same industry roles, because I wanted to bring back a layer of missing software engineers 
from academia.

I work as a software engineer for the Stanford Research Computer Center 
with this goal as the prime focus. Over the last two years I have realized the power of
open source development. It is more than opening a pull request on Github, it is dually 
thinking about the design of systems and incentives of the users that flow through them. 
What I've learned is that open source is powerful, and inspiring, but in a logical twist, 
the culture is being underutilized where it is most badly needed, in the development of
strong, quality open source tools for academia.

There are two primary issues at hand. The first is that young scientists do not have
provided in their training the basic skills that originate from software engineering
to practice sound work. The second is that the flow of people and incentives to guide
development of tools are not catered for the academic researcher. Thus, it seems logical
to develop a framework of teaching that might drive development of these missing tools,
and train new scientists in the process. My intention as a research
software engineer and educator is to do impactful work to address these issues, and 
I realize that to have the impact that I desire, research software engineers must go beyond 
the expected role and bring vision fully into an academic department. Open
source software engineering must be brought into a traditional university environment, so that students
are familiar with the practices from day one. An institution should have a team of staff, researchers,
and students that procure funding and take ownership of essential projects related to reproducible
scientific software and infrastructure. Traditionally service departments
like research computing should be involved in the process of research, and allowed
to write grants to secure funding for it. There must be a wider selection of hats
to wear beyond solely a PI, researcher, or teacher. This introduces the rationale for the
Open Source Lab - a strategy and culture in computer science education that teaches by way of actual
participation in open source development, and does collaborative work on real world problems.

This is a logical avenue to pursue. We are lacking tools and practices for reproducible science. 
These practices and the tooling that results from them are heralded by open source. Thus, 
we can kill two birds with one stone by bringing open source software engineering to inspire a team of students
to learn and build valuable resources for the larger community.
